* `LDA.ipynb` This notebook carries out the training process of a Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model.
* `NMF.ipynb` This notebook carries out the training process of a Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)  topic model.
* `BERTopic.ipynb` This notebook carries out the training process of BERTopic.
* `create_embeddings.ipynb` For error analysis this project created an embedded space. This notebook carries out the process of creating an embedded space.
* `error_analysis.ipynb` This note is responsible for the error analysis based on pairwise cosine similarity.
